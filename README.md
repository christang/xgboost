xgboost-unity
=======
experimental branch(not usable yet): refactor xgboost, cleaner code, more flexibility

Build
======
* Simply type make
* If your compiler does not come with OpenMP support, it will fire an warning telling you that the code will compile into single thread mode, and you will get single thread xgboost
* You may get a error: -lgomp is not found, you can remove -fopenmp flag in Makefile to get single thread xgboost, or upgrade your compiler to compile multi-thread version
* Possible way to build using Visual Studio (not tested):
   - In principle, you can put src/xgboost.cpp and src/io/io.cpp into the project, and build xgboost.
   - For python module, you need python/xgboost_wrapper.cpp and src/io/io.cpp to build a dll.
